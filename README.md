# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
A consulting firm called Artemis Financial creates unique financial strategies for each of its clients. Savings, retirement, investments, and insurance are some of these services. Secure communications, the ability to conduct global transactions, the consideration of legislative constraints, current and potential external threats, and software modernization are among the software needs for the client.

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Finding solutions to the obvious vulnerabilities, implementing suggestions to adhere to proper coding practices, and outlining the significance of why these vulnerabilities exist and the steps that must be taken to prevent future vulnerabilities are some of the qualities that I effectively implemented when identifying the client's software security flaws. The importance of software security contributes to organizational integrity, boosts productivity, and complies with stringent legal requirements while creating systems or infrastructures.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Finding the right fix for the vulnerabilities was the part of the vulnerability assessment that I found to be difficult. I was able to further improve the security of the client's program after finding the vulnerability and putting it into practice over several hours, which increased the system's integration and effectiveness.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
By incorporating a wide range of elements into the vulnerability risk management diagram, I improved the levels of security. These include using APIs, validating input, comprehending code quality, following the right client/server protocols, and putting cryptography into practice. In the future, I would be able to quickly examine different vulnerabilities and determine how to execute a mitigation method, such as adopting a mitigation plan that specifically identifies the vulnerability. I would also put into place an action process that evaluates every vulnerability and helps the team locate and resolve the curated mitigation strategy.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
By following the rules and regulations of appropriate functional and secure protocol, I ensured that the specific code and software application were both functional and secure. These include determining the risk present in the software application's code, locating the relevant vulnerabilities, and appropriately implementing mitigation strategies / plans to reduce it. After reworking the code, I would also develop a maven build that would perform a dependency check to determine whether the vulnerabilities were still there. If they were, I would then appropriately implement strategies to address any newly discovered vulnerabilities.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The resources, tools, or coding techniques I employed—such as using high-quality code, conducting suitable documentation analyses, and properly using editors and integrated development environments—might prove useful in the future. If necessary, I would also use my professor and my fellow students.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would demonstrate to potential employers the documentation I produced for the task, demonstrating how I was able to recognize the client's vulnerabilities and how to handle them effectively. The task would in part demonstrate my writing abilities and the degree to which all requirements were accomplished.

I am very grateful for your time professor! I hope you have a great rest of your day! I am truly grateful! Take care!

Sincerely,
Lawrence
